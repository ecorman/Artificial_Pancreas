Artificial_Pancreas
===================

Artificial Pancreas Project in MATLAB from Medtronic CareLink CSV Export (2011)

This is based on the mathematical models from Roman Hovorka's work. The main.m file executes the other functions in the code. Gfind.m, GlucoseInsulinModel.m, and GlucoseInsulinModelWrap.m are the most interesting functions.

This program will not work with new Medtronic CareLink CSV Exports, as the data formatting has changed.
